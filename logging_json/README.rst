==============
JSON Logging
==============

This addon allows to output the Odoo logs in JSON.


It also add the possibility to log extra data in json in your log.
See documentation of json logger here : https://github.com/madzak/python-json-logger

Example:

.. code-block:: python

   _logger.info('My Message', extra={
       'my_extra_key_1': 'value_1',
       'my_extra_key_2': 'value_2'})

The key "extra" is a standard key of logger module so you can add this key and your log will work with or without this module (see documentation here : https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html#logging.Logger.debug)


Configuration
=============

The json logging is activated with the environment variable
``ODOO_LOGGING_JSON`` set to ``1``.

In order to have the logs from the start of the server, you should add
``logging_json`` in the ``--load`` flag or in the ``server_wide_modules``
option in the configuration file.

If you want to see the extra keys when you are developping in local
but with the odoo logger output and not the JSON output
you can add the environment variable ``ODOO_LOGGING_JSON_DEV`` set to ``1``.

Note : ``ODOO_LOGGING_JSON_DEV`` and ``ODOO_LOGGING_JSON`` should be not set both to ``1``

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Completed the extraction (in regex) of interesting message to get more metric
